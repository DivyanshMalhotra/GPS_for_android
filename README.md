# GPS_for_android
This application enables you to access gps values on your phone and displays latitude, Longitude, Altitude and Speed.
It uses a location listener to access the location values and keeps updating. It has a minimalist layout. Feel free to use.
Notice: It, just like other GPS apps, may work erratically inside due to improper network.
